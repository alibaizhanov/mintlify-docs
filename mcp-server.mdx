## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) lets AI clients like Claude Desktop and Cursor connect to external tools. Mengram's MCP server gives these clients persistent memory.

## Setup with Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mengram": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mengram-ai"],
      "env": {
        "MENGRAM_API_KEY": "om-your-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Setup with Cursor

Add to Cursor's MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mengram": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mengram-ai"],
      "env": {
        "MENGRAM_API_KEY": "om-your-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Available tools

The MCP server exposes 21 tools:
