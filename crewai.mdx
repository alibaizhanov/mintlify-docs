## Installation

```bash
pip install mengram-ai[crewai]
```

## Quick start

```python
from integrations.crewai import create_mengram_tools  # included in mengram-ai
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Create memory tools
tools = create_mengram_tools(api_key="om-your-key")

agent = Agent(
    role="Support Engineer",
    goal="Help users with technical issues using past context",
    tools=tools,
)

task = Task(
    description="Help the user debug their deployment issue",
    agent=agent,
)

crew = Crew(agents=[agent], tasks=[task])
result = crew.kickoff()
```

## Available tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `mengram_search` | Search all 3 memory types (semantic, episodic, procedural) |
| `mengram_remember` | Save information to memory (auto-extracts all 3 types) |
| `mengram_profile` | Get full user context via Cognitive Profile |
| `mengram_save_workflow` | Save a completed workflow as a procedure |
| `mengram_workflow_feedback` | Report success/failure of a workflow |

## Procedural learning

When a CrewAI agent completes a multi-step task, Mengram automatically saves it as a procedure. Next time a similar task comes up, the agent already knows the optimal path — with success/failure tracking.

```python
# Agent workflow is automatically extracted as a procedure
# On next similar task, the agent retrieves the procedure
results = tools[0].run("how to deploy to Railway")
# Returns the learned procedure with steps
```
