## What is a Cognitive Profile?

A Cognitive Profile is an AI-generated system prompt that summarizes everything Mengram knows about a user: identity, preferences, communication style, current projects, and key relationships. Insert it into any LLM's system prompt for instant personalization.

## Generate a profile

```python
from mengram import Mengram

m = Mengram()
profile = m.get_profile()

print(profile["system_prompt"])
# "You are talking to Ali, a software engineer based in ...
#  He prefers concise responses, uses Python and Railway..."

print(profile["facts_used"])  # 47 — number of facts used
```

## Use in an LLM call

```python
import openai

profile = m.get_profile(user_id="alice")

response = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": profile["system_prompt"]},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What should I focus on this week?"},
    ]
)
```

## Force regeneration

Profiles are cached for performance. Force a fresh one with:

```python
profile = m.get_profile(force=True)
```

## Multi-user profiles

Generate profiles for different end-users in your app:

```python
alice_profile = m.get_profile(user_id="alice")
bob_profile = m.get_profile(user_id="bob")
```

## LangChain integration

```python
from langchain_mengram import get_mengram_profile

# Returns a string you can use as system prompt
prompt = get_mengram_profile(api_key="om-...", user_id="alice")
```
